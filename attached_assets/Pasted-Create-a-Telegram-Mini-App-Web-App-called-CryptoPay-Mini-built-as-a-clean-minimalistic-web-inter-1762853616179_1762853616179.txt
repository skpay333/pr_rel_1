Create a Telegram Mini App (Web App) called CryptoPay Mini, built as a clean, minimalistic web interface that runs smoothly inside Telegram.
This project must be self-contained (no external AI Agents, no Automations) — just a regular app with a simple server and front-end that I can host for free or under my existing Replit subscription.

🧭 Concept

This mini-app simulates a Telegram bot that lets users:

Top up an internal balance in USDT (TRC20)

See the USDT→RUB conversion rate and their balance in rubles

Create payment requests in rubles

Track payment history

Access support information

Everything should look and feel like a light-weight Revolut-style wallet interface — modern, smooth, and intuitive.

🧱 App structure
1. Welcome screen

Greeting:
“Hey! I’m your crypto payment assistant. Pay in RUB using USDT (TRC20). Fast, secure, and simple.”

Button: “Open My Wallet”

2. Main dashboard

Shows three blocks:

USDT Balance (example: 120.50 USDT)

Exchange rate (1 USDT ≈ 90 RUB)

RUB Equivalent (10 845 ₽)

Main buttons:

➕ Top Up

💳 Pay

Bottom navigation bar:

🏠 Home | 🧾 History | 🆘 Support | ⚙️ Settings

3. Top-Up page

Displays the fixed TRC-20 wallet address (from environment variable).

Button “Copy address”.

Note: “Funds appear after admin confirmation.”

4. Pay page

Step-by-step form:

Input field — “Enter amount in ₽”

Choose urgency:

⚡ Urgent (5–10 min)

⏱️ Standard (10–30 min)

Field to paste a link or describe the bill (simulate attachment).

Optional comment field.

Confirmation screen: show RUB amount, USDT equivalent, rate, urgency, and “Submit” button.
After submission: show success card — “✅ Request submitted. We’ll process it soon.”

5. History page

Scrollable list of cards, each showing:

RUB amount

USDT equivalent

Urgency type

Status (Submitted / Paid / Processing / Rejected)

Date/time

6. Support page

Contact block:
“Need help? Contact @supportname or support@example.com
.”

7. Settings page

Shows basic profile info (username, registration date).

Option to simulate “Log out” or “Clear data”.

🎨 Design & UX

Style: Revolut / N26 / Monzo look — clean, flat, elegant.

Colors: white background, light grey cards, blue accent, soft shadow, rounded corners.

Typography: modern sans-serif, large numbers for balances.

Animations: subtle fade transitions between pages.

Responsive: must look perfect in Telegram WebView and mobile.

⚙️ Functionality

All data (users, balances, requests) can be stored locally (JSON or SQLite) for simplicity.

Exchange rate: simulated fixed value (e.g. 90 RUB per USDT) with slight random fluctuation.

Include basic server endpoints so Telegram can open this mini-app via web link.

Auto-deploy and give me the final public URL (example: https://cryptopay-mini.<username>.replit.app/telegram-miniapp).

🪄 What I expect from Replit

Generate a complete working mini-app, ready to open in Telegram.

Deploy automatically on my Replit domain.

Print at the end:

The final public URL of the mini-app.

A short instruction:

“Copy this URL and add it in @BotFather → Edit Menu Button → Add Web App → Paste link → Save.”

That should be the only manual step I need to do.
Everything else — code, styling, hosting, deployment — should be handled automatically.
